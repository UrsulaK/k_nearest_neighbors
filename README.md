# k_nearest_neighbors

Here are two Java classes to test the K nearest neighbors algorithm.

1. The KNN.java nad the Movie.java

  With this classes I tried to get familiar with the knn algorithm. I made it very simple with a small dataset to see what happens.

2. The KNNWithNormalization.java and the Entry.java

  Here the knn class has become a little more abstract, the data is loaded from a file and an entry can have an arbitrary amount of attributes and types. Furthermore it works with normalization.
